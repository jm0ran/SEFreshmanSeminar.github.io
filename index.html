        Who Am I
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Joseph Moran. I'm from Bridgeport, Connecticut and attended RIT with the goal of becoming a Software Engineer. I've coded rather casually for the past six years and have been excited to learn the "right" way to do it. In terms of hobbies, I don't have any that are too unique. I'm pretty into homelab and networking and have a server running from my house.
